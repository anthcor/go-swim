# marlin
a go library that implements the swim protocol

incase you're wondering why i've named the project _marlin_; it's because marlins swim fast :fish:

marlin was developed with inspiration from this [paper](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf).

todo ::
- make sure each server knows one another
- implement the failure detector
